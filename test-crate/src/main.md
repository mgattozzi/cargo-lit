# Let's Learn Some Rust

When writing a Rust program (not a library) we need a very special function to
be declared!

```rust
fn main() {
```
Look at this strong and powerful function. They are my friend. Now, we might
want to get started with some code. Inevitably you'll be greeted with this bit
of code:

```rust
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Running this code should cause your computer to spit out 'Hello, world!'.
Congrats you've written some Rust.
