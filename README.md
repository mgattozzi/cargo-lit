A cargo subcommand to do [literate programming][literate] in Rust.

## Current Status

cargo-lit is currently experimental and might eat your code up. Use it with
caution. It also does not implement everything needed to be considered literate
programming. It is *at most* a comment extraction tool, but that will change
over time.

The current minimum Rust version supported is 1.37 stable.

## Code of Conduct

We have a Code of Conduct so as to create a more enjoyable community and
work environment. Please see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
file for more details.

## PR Restrictions

PRs will not be accepted if you *currently* work for the following companies.
This list is not exhaustive and subject to change. This project does not want
material support of any kind as these companies have been fueling either
inequality, the surveillance state in the USA, supporting ICE, doing unethical
business practices or by having it's workforce work under inhumane conditions.
Receiving help in any form is a tacit acceptance of these practices. While we
can't legally stop companies from using this software we don't have to accept
their help in building it. If you no longer work at these companies then we
are happy to accept your contributions.
